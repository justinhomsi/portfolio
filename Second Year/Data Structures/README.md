# Data Structures
A collection of python scripts that demonstrate algorithms associated with data structures including:<br />

Bubble Sort Algorithm.<br />
Binary Search Tree Insertion and Traversal: Insertion and In-Order Traversal.<br />
Algorithm Analysis: Code to analyze different sorting algorithms by number of comparisons and running time in milliseconds.<br />
Binary Search Tree Advanced Traversal: Insertion of an array into a BST; Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order traversal; Printing of all leaf and non-leaf nodes, and depth of tree.<br />
Selection Sort Algorithm.<br />
