# Programming Principles
A simple program designed to allow a user to enter details of games which are then saved to a text file, which can be searched to find saved games<br />

"admin.py" is the CLI which allows the user to manage the details of games that are stored in a text file<br />
"gamefinder.py" is the GUI which uses the data stored in the text file to allow a user to find game which match the criteria they specify.
