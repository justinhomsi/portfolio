# Room Booking System
This assignment involved the creation of a room booking system using PHP, MySQL, and HTML.

It allows users to create new rooms within the system, and set specific characteristics of said room (such as equipment present in the room),
view rooms, and search rooms by name or equipment. The system also allows for users to export upcoming room bookings in an iCalendar format (.ics file).

The system also features event logging which logs significant events which happen on the site.
