# FuzzyControllerv2
This is a controller designed to play Saucers, a game in which 13 saucers compete in a battle royale, using Fuzzy Logic.

Saucers within the game are able to move, attack, use shields, and collect powerups which appear randomly on the map.<br />
Saucers have a set amount of energy with which they begin the game. This energy is depleted when the saucer moves, attacks or uses shields.<br />
Attacks use a higher amount of energy depending on the power of the attack. High powered attacks consume more energy but deal more damage when hitting an enemy than low power attacks.<br />

The strategy employed by FuzzyControllerv2 is an aggressive strategy. It is designed to move at maximum speeds at all times to assist with dodging attacks, 
and will only fire at enemies when they are within an extremely close distance to ensure that attacks do not miss and energy is not wasted.<br />
The controller does not employ the use of shields, as this was determined to be a waste of energy compared to dodging attacks.<br />

Controllers developed by all groups within the unit were entered into a competition to determine which group's controller was the most effective.
This competition involved 10 rounds with all developed controllers present. FuzzyControllerv2 had an overall ranking of first place.
