# MicroRTS AI System
The MicroRTS AI System is designed to allow the evolution of an AI using Genetic Programming algorithms.<br /> 
The system is comprised of three modules: MicroRTS, Java Behaviour Trees (JBT), and the Evolutionary Computational Toolkit in Java (ECJ)<br />

The aim of the system is to produce an evolved behaviour tree which will control unit decision making within a MicroRTS simulation in order to discover novel strategies to win<br />

To run the program, please download the "User JARs" zip folder and refer to the User Manual for instructions.<br />

For a detailed breakdown of the program's code, please refer to the Technical Manual.
