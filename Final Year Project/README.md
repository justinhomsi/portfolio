# MicroRTS AI System
The MicroRTS AI System is designed to allow the evolution of an AI using Genetic Programming algorithms.<br /> 
The system is comprised of three modules: MicroRTS, Java Behaviour Trees (JBT), and the Evolutionary Computational Toolkit in Java (ECJ)<br />

The aim of the system is to produce an evolved behaviour tree which will control unit decision making within a MicroRTS simulation in order to discover novel strategies to win<br />

To run the program, please download the "User JARs" zip file and refer to the User Manual for instructions.<br />

For a detailed breakdown of the program's code, and for instructions on how to install the system for modification of the source code, please refer to the Technical Manual. The source code is contained within the "MicroRTS_System_AI" zip file.<br />
